 *  @brief  Command to set the copy block for an NVS block.
 *
 *  Passing NVSMSP432_CMD_SET_COPYBLOCK to NVS_control(), along with
 *  a block of memory, is used to set the copy block for an
 *  NVSMSP432_HWAttrs structure.
 *  The copy block is used as scratch when writing to a flash block.  Since
 *  the block must be erased before writing to it, the data in the block
 *  that is outside of the region to be modified, must be preserved.  It
 *  will be copied into the copy block, along with the buffer of data
 *  passed to NVS_write().  The block is then erased and the copy block
 *  copied back to the block.  If the copy block is not known at compile
 *  time, for example, if it is allocated from heap memory, it can be set
 *  through NVS_control() using the command NVSMSP432_CMD_SET_COPYBLOCK.
 *  The copy block is passed in the arg parameter of NVS_control().  The
 *  size of the copy block passed to NVS_control() must be at least
 *  as large as the block size, and it is up to the application to ensure
 *  this.

 *  @brief      NVSMSP432 attributes
 *
 *  The block is the address of a region in flash of size blockSize bytes.
 *
 *  For MSP432 devices, the smallest erase page size is 4KB, so in most
 *  cases, blockSize should be set to 4KB for this device.  If the
 *  blockSize is less than the page size, care should be taken not to use
 *  the rest of the page.  A write to the block will cause the entire page
 *  to be erased!  A blockSize greater than the page size is not supported.
 *  The page size for the device can be obtained through NVS_getAttrs().
 *
 *  When the block is written to, a scratch region is needed to preserve
 *  the unmodified data in the block.  This scratch region, referred to as
 *  copyBlock, can be a page in flash or a buffer in RAM.  The application
 *  can set copyBlock in the HWAttrs directly, if it is known at compile
 *  time, or set copyBlock through NVS_control(), for example, if it is
 *  allocated on the heap.  The copyBlock can be shared accross multiple
 *  NVS instances.  It is up to the application to ensure that copyBlock
 *  is set before the first call to NVS_write().
 *  Using a blockSize less than the page size decreases RAM or heap only
 *  if copyBlock is not in flash.
